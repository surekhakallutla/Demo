Add of two Numbers

Algorithm:
1. take one i/p from user
2. take second i/p from user
3. perform addition with + operator
4. return result to user

Test Driven Development(TDD)
int:
1. both i/p +ve numbers
2. both i/p -ve numbers
3. one num +ve one -ve
4. one num -ve one +ve
5. both numbers zero
float:
1. both i/p +ve numbers
2. both i/p -ve numbers
3. one num +ve one -ve
4. one num -ve one +ve
5. both numbers zero
